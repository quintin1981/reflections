1. What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

Git creates a folder called .git. This will be used to track and log changes to the files within the new git repository.

2. How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

The staging area, I think, is an intermediate between the working dirctory and the respository, allowing you to choose multiple files before commiting them to the repository.

3. How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?

I guess I can use the staging area to hang on to the file until Ive made changes, then commit it. Im not really sure.
