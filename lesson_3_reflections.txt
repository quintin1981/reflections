1. When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

If you have to access your work from multiple devices and locations I imagine a remote repository becomes very useful.

2. Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

Because you may not want certain things updated right away. manual is better most of the time.

3. Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

A fork is a copy of someone elses project on github, a clone is a copy from a github account and a branch is divergence from a master set of commits allowing for multiple changes to be made without altering the master project.

4. What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

The benefit is knowing the last changes that were made before you left the project, so any changes afterward can be recognized and dealt with.

5. How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?

probably over email, or the phone. Maybe chat rooms or skype. some changes would probably be quicker to just tell the perso about, but for larger project changes I would think trying to communicate those changes would be very hard indeed. I imagine it would take alot longer too.

6. When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in master? What benefits does each approach have?

When the changes are likely to be large and experimental with manny commits I would want to use a separate branch to more easily see my work as well as not affecting the master project in the process. Making changes in master is beeficial for minor changes or additions, but making them in a separate branch adds the benefit of easy reading and separation of ideas
