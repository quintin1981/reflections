1. When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

If you have to access your work from multiple devices and locations I imagine a remote repository becomes very useful.

2. Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

Because you may not want certain things updated right away. manual is better most of the time.

3. Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

A fork is a copy of someone elses project on github, a clone is a copy from a github account and a branch is divergence from a master set of commits allowing for multiple changes to be made without altering the master project.
